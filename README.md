# The Scalar Waze - Theory of Everything

This repository hosts *The Scalar Waze Theory of Everything* (SW-TOE), a unified framework for fundamental physics in a six-dimensional (6D) spacetime \( (t, x, y, z, v, u) \), developed by Travis Jones. The theory introduces the scalar field \( \phi_N \) as the Unified Variant, coupling quantum dynamics to gravity, with negative energy manifesting as a spin-1/2, massless Weyl-like field at singularities.

## Overview
The SW-TOE extends spacetime with \( v \) (quantum superposition) and \( u \) (entanglement) dimensions. Inspired by the integral \( \int \phi_N^2 \sin \phi_N \, d\phi_N \), it integrates Schumann frequencies and Pythagorean harmonic ratios to align gravity with quantum geometry, enabling exotic phenomena like wormholes and closed timelike curves (CTCs).
